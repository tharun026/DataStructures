Scala - Scalable Language
Features:
	High Level programming language
	Pure Object oriented programming language and also supports functional programming approach
	Scala programs get converted into .class file which contains Java Byte Code after the successful compilation 
		and then can run on JVM(Java Virtual Machine).


Array:
	Mutable collection - values can be changed.
	Size cannot be changed. Defined data type
	values are indexed. Index starts from 0.
	We can access any element of an array in time O(1) if we know it's index.
	Worst case for finding an element in array O(n). If array is sorted, O(log n).
	Array Functions:
		reverse
		sorted
		exists - will return true or false
		filter - will return the actual entries
